# d2d-tutorials
A repository containing tutorials for the graphics package d2d. These tutorials are intended to be interactive and to teach not only how one can use the features of the package, but also the places they can be useful. These tutorials assume working knowledge of the D language, so some parts of the tutorial may be confusing if you do not know some parts of the D language. To get started with d2d, start with the first tutorial and gradually move along. To download all of the tutorials, simply download or clone this repository. Using the sample code is not necessary, but it is recommended for seeing what the code does and how it does it.
